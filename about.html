      <br>
      <p style="font-size: x-large;"> In a <strong><span></span>world</strong> where Inflation is King! Gas prices are outlandish, formula
      shortages is a thing, demands for Remote Work have skyrocketed. I type up my intro while struggling to get items to align. Here is my story: </p><br>

      <p style="font-size: x-large;">Who am I? The name is Tiarious, but you can call me Tia. I'm a momma to a smart high-engery two year old, did I mention high energy?
        I enjoy long nap-times, Traveling (pre-covid) and Surfing TikTok for receipe videos. I am here to dedicate my time, energy and possibly tears to become a Software Engineer. I have always wanted to enter the Tech Field,
        however I've always talked myself out of trying, because I felt I wasn't good enough... Until <b>NOW!</b> A friend of my
        told me about PerScholas and I decided to bet on myself, to finally attempt to do what I've always wanted do!
        I look forward to working with you all during this 15-week journey.
